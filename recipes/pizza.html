        5-10 minutes until yeast is activated.
      </li>

      <li>
        Knead the dough for 5-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let
        it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
